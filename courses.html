                <p class="paragraph">
                    So, you thought this was over? Not quite. I also participated in courses 
                    that were supposed to be taught in German, as advertised and also confirmed 
                    before enrolment. But was that the case? Not really.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Much like with jobs, they don‚Äôt care if you understand or not. Once you‚Äôve paid, 
                    they take no responsibility. The teachers would regularly switch to Swiss German, 
                    despite the course being in German. I had to interrupt, and other students were 
                    also asking questions in Swiss German. If you don‚Äôt understand, that‚Äôs apparently your problem.

                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Will you pay 6'000 CHF for such a course? Well I did and you can imagine investing 
                    time and money in something like this is not acceptable.
