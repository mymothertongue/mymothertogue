                    Here I am going to be short. The above email is the one I send 
                    if someone uses Swiss German in my presence during any work-related 
                    conversation that can impact my job.

                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    I do not mind conversations held in Swiss German during coffee breaks, 
                    lunch, or any private matters, as I do not participate in those talks.
                </p>
  
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Everyone is free to choose the language they communicate in, but when 
                    it affects your job and performance, it cannot be accepted and must be
                    reported to the authorities. In my experience, neither Chefs nor HR take 
                    action, as the easiest solution is to get rid of the non-xenophobic employee.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    By setting precedents with these emails, it becomes harder for Chefs/HR 
                    to dismiss you, and it also strengthens your position in any legal actions 
                    against this type of illegal behavior.
