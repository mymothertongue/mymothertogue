                <p class="paragraph">
                    Here I am going to be short. The above email is the one I send If someone uses
                    Swiss German with me present at any conversation at the working place, that can 
                    have an impact on my job. 

                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    I do not care about conversations at the coffee break, lunch or any private stuff,
                    as I do not participate on those talks If they are held in Swiss German.
                </p>
  
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Everyone is free to chose in which language to communicate, but when this affects
                    your job and performace, it cannot be accepted and has to be reported to the authorities,
                    as in my experience neither Chefs, nor HR will take actions as the easy way is to get rid 
                    of the non-xenophobic employee.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    And by setting this emails precedences, it will make harder to Chefs/HR to get rid of you,
                    and also will help you with any legal actions against this kind of ilegal behaviours.
